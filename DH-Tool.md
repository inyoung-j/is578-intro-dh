    1) Name of the tool: Python
    2) Link to the tool: <https://www.python.org/>
    3) Link to the abstract or DH project: <https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/11841>
    4) A short description: Python can be used for multiple purposes. 
    In this research, the author used Python 
    with Natural Language Processing to tokenize, 
    tag, and parse corpus from the chosen document 
    and extract spatial data concerning 
    the cognitive mapping of the document. 
    This helps distance reading effectively, 
    widens understanding of the document 
    along with the social and cultural aspects, 
    and opens up further discussion. 
    I have used Python for basic metadata sorting and extracting. 
    Still, I’m a beginner at this tool and 
    want to learn more about this tool for my future work.

    1) Name of the tool: Srophé App 
    2) Link to the tool: <https://srophe.app/>
    3) Link to the abstract or DH project: <https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/11970>
    4) A short description: The Srophé App is an open-source database for digital humanities research in the history of culture and encoding cultural heritage. Scholars can encode and link historical data with texts, persons, geography, events, and material artifacts. This tool can be used for digital projects for distant reading, architectural analysis, and geographical studies. I’ve never used this tool before, but I have used ArcGIS, a Geographic Information System (GIS) to display and create interactive geographic data with texts, locations, and images. I want to explore the Srophé App compare this tool to ArcGIS, and find out which tool suits me the most.
