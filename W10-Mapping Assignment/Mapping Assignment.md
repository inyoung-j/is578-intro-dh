# Mapping Assignment
by Inyoung Jang


I used and compared <b>Geojason.io</b> and <b>Kepler.gl</b> with the dataset from our class.

<br>
<br>

* What is the process of uploading data to the tool or creating a map? Is it easy or difficult?

<b>Geojson.io:</b> Open a file or just drag and drop a file. Very intuitive.
<br><b>Kepler.gl:</b> Open or drag and drop a file. It was very easy and intuitive because when I loaded the website it just showed the window for opening a file.
<br>


* What sort of visualization options does the tool have? Are you able to visualize the data how you imagined? Are there any limitations?

<b>Geojson.io:</b> I can map the data on the 3D globe and the 2D map. Connecting different locations is also available using strings. There are many tools on the right side but the instructions for the tools are not clear.
However, I can try them one by one and figure it out. Maybe it’s because I’m not used to mapping datasets, but I don’t find limitations with Geojson.
<br><b>Kepler.gl:</b> Adding a location or connecting different locations with a string is not found at the moment. But I can make polygons or rectangles with locations. It also provides a detailed instruction webpage.
<br>

* What sort of interactivity does the tool have? Is it easy to filter or explore the data?

<b>Geojson.io:</b> 
Clicking and dragging are interactively functioning with the tool. 
I can search the data with the search box, and click the location to add or edit the data rows. 
<br><b>Kepler.gl:</b> Clicking and zooming in/out are available. I can filter the data with the filter button. When I activate a filter, it opens a related window to view the graphs.
Each tool and button has a name or explanation when I toggle it. 
<br>


* Can you export the map? If so, what formats are available? Can you embed the map in a website?

<b>Geojson.io:</b> 
I cannot find the exporting button but the save button. With this, txt or cvs files are available. 
<br><b>Kepler.gl:</b> I can export my map as an image, civ, map with HTML/JSON, and share public URLs with Dropbox.
