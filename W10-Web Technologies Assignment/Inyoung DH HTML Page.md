# Web Technologies Assignment: Creating a DH HTML page

Starting from scratch, I created my DH HTML page.
I used Visual Studio Code for code editing.
I have experienced HTML and CSS a long time ago, but never used Visual Studio Code before. However, I found this tool was  intuitive and helpful for me to build the code.
I also visited [W3 Schools HTML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) to learn more about HTML codes.
