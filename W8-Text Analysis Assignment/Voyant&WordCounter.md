# Exploratory Text Analysis: Analyzing Texts with DH Tools

I compared WordCounter from DataBasic and Voyant Tools with the [data](https://github.com/ZoeLeBlanc/is578-intro-dh/blob/gh-pages/public_course_data/data_analysis_examples/voyant/topic_modeling/voyant_combined_abstracts_topic_modeling.txt).


I believe WordCounter is more simple and intuitive in its design. You can find the WordCloud along with top words, bigrams, and trigrams. Also, I can download results such as top words and bigrams directly while Voyant provides only the exported data file. 

Voyant has a more detailed explanation with a variety of options. It provides multiple windows to view the overall and individual estimations simultaneously. I can control the bar to maximize or minimize the word cloud and review every single token/word. I think Voyant would be more applicable in research works with its information and format. For WordCounter, I would use it for presentations and writings.

One thing I found strange is that somehow Voyant shows more article and preposition words although I checked the button for removing the stop word.
